## MPC X AA DApp
 A NextJs app that uses the Stackup SDK. This DApp allows users to pair with the silent Shard app, mint a smart contact account, and create transactions on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites:
- Node.js v16.13.0 or higher
- Check .env.example file and setup environment variables before running the app

## Setting Up Environment Variables
1. Create a .env file:
- In the root of your project, create a new file named .env

2. Fill in your API keys in .env:
    ``` bash
    API_KEY = your_stackup_api_key_here //update this API key using step 3 below
    ```
3. Set the rpcUrl:
- To set the rpcUrl, you can create an instance at app.stackup.sh. Follow these steps:
- Create an account or log in if you already have one.
- Select the Sepolia network for your instance.
- Once the instance is created, navigate to the "Instances" tab.
- Copy the API Key for your instance and replace API_KEY in the rpcUrl with your actual API Key.
- You can also set up a paymaster (optional) by configuring the paymaster section:

### How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to run dev version

Once started, the app is running on http://localhost:3000/. Ensure that you use only port 3000 strictly.
